# AceXR

AceXR Technical Assessment:
 
* Set up a new Unity project using version 2021.3.14f1
* Set up an OpenXR rig for the player that joins a multiplayer game using Photon PUN 2.
* Create a basic white cube prefab childed to one of the hand controllers.
* When pressing the different buttons on the controller make it swap the color of the cube to different colors that can be seen by all players in the game.
* Create a zone/collider in the scene that when entered by any player’s cube it makes all players move to another scene where their previous cubes disappear and everyone now has a capsule childed to their hand instead with no adjustable color interactions.
* In this second scene is another zone/collider that when entered by any player’s capsule makes all players return to the previous scene with boxes instead of capsules and their previous box colors are the colors they were when they left the scene.
